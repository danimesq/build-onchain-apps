45:5  Warning: React Hook useMemo has a missing dependency: 'pageSize'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps


The warning you're seeing is from the ESLint `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule, which helps ensure that all variables used inside `useMemo`, `useEffect`, and similar hooks are properly listed in the dependency array. This is to ensure that the hook correctly re-runs when any of those dependencies change.

In your `useOnchainCoffeeMemos` hook, you're using `pageSize` inside the `useMemo` but it's not included in the dependency array. To resolve the warning, you should add `pageSize` to the dependency array of `useMemo`.

Here's the corrected part of your code:

```typescript:./app/buy-me-coffee/_hooks/useOnchainCoffeeMemos.ts
return useMemo(
  () => ({
    memos:
      contractReadResult.status === 'success' ? (contractReadResult.data as CoffeeMemo[]) : [],
    refetchMemos: contractReadResult.refetch,
    currentPage,
    goToNextPage,
    goToPreviousPage,
    pageSize,
  }),
  [contractReadResult, currentPage, goToNextPage, goToPreviousPage, pageSize], // Added pageSize here
);
```

This change ensures that if `pageSize` changes, the memoized value will be recalculated.
