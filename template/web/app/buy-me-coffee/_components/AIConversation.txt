About @MemoCard.tsx 's pagination: what is the maximum amount of items to be displayed?



The `MemoCard.tsx` component itself does not handle pagination directly. It is designed to display a single memo item. The handling of how many `MemoCard` components are displayed (i.e., pagination) would typically be managed by a parent component that iterates over a list of memos and decides how many to render based on pagination logic.

From the provided code snippets, it appears that pagination is managed in the `Page.tsx` component, specifically using the `useOnchainCoffeeMemos` hook which includes pagination functionality (`currentPage`, `goToPreviousPage`, `goToNextPage`). However, the exact maximum number of items displayed per page (page size) is set in the `BuyUsCupcakePage` function within `Page.tsx`:


```9:10:app/components/Page.tsx
  const pageSize = 5;
  const { memos, refetchMemos, currentPage, goToPreviousPage, goToNextPage } =
```


Here, the `pageSize` is set to `5`, meaning the maximum number of `MemoCard` components displayed per page is 5. This value is used to fetch and control the display of memos accordingly.








I need something: until the pageSize is reached (example there are 1, or 2, or 3, or 4, or 5 but not 6 items), make a clear disabled design for the "Read older messages" and "Read newer messages" buttons!




To implement a clear disabled design for the "Read older messages" and "Read newer messages" buttons based on the `pageSize` and the number of items, you can adjust the `disabled` attribute logic in the `Button` components within the `Page.tsx` file. Here's how you can modify the code:

### Updated `Page.tsx`
```typescript:app/components/Page.tsx
54|              onClick={goToPreviousPage}
55|              disabled={currentPage === 0}  // Disable if on the first page
56|              buttonContent={<span>Read older messages</span>}
57|              className={clsx('w-auto px-10', { 'opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed': currentPage === 0 })}
58|
59|            <div className="text-black">Page {currentPage + 1}</div>
60|
61|            <Button
62|              onClick={goToNextPage}
63|              disabled={memos.length < pageSize}  // Disable if less than pageSize items
64|              buttonContent={<span>Read newer messages</span>}
65|              className={clsx('w-auto px-10', { 'opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed': memos.length < pageSize })}
```

This code snippet uses the `clsx` library to conditionally apply CSS classes that make the buttons appear disabled (`opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed`) when the conditions for being disabled are met. Specifically:
- The "Read older messages" button is disabled and styled as such when `currentPage` is `0`.
- The "Read newer messages" button is disabled and styled as such when the number of `memos` is less than `pageSize`.

This approach ensures that the buttons not only are functionally disabled but also clearly appear disabled to the user, enhancing the UI's intuitiveness.
